# Application_server

![](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/What-is-Application-Server-1.1.png)

Your web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that you installed in [your first web stack project](https://github.com/sammykingx/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x0C-web_server). While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project you will add this piece to your infrastructure, plug it to your __Nginx__ and make is serve your __Airbnb clone project.__

## Project Requirements

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Everything Python-related must be done using `python3`
- All config files must have comments
- All your files will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (`version 0.3.7-5~ubuntu16.04.1` via `apt-get`) without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing.

### Project task
- 0. Set up development with Python
	Letâ€™s serve what you built for AirBnB clone v2 - Web framework on web-01. This task is an exercise in setting up your development environment, which is used for testing and debugging your code before deploying it to production.

	__Requirements:__

	- Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01. The checker will connect to your servers.
	- Git clone your AirBnB_clone_v2 on your web-01 server.
	- Configure the file web_flask/0-hello_route.py to serve its content from the route /airbnb-onepage/ on port 5000.
	- Your Flask application object must be named app (This will allow us to run and check your code).

#### Solving task 0
- git clone Airbnb_clone_v2
- edit the file 0-hello_route.py by replacing "/" with "airbnb_onepage"

```bash
(venv) ubuntu@64820-web-01:~/AirBnB_clone_v2$ python3 -m web_flask.0-hello_route
 * Serving Flask app '0-hello_route'
 * Debug mode: off
