A __Secure Shell__, or __Secure Socket Shell__, is a network protocol that allows devices to achieve two important things: communicate and share data. Additionally, the SSH protocol also encrypts data, making it ideal for unsecured networks.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a __server__
- Where servers usually live
- What is `SSH`
- How to create an `SSH RSA` key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

## Projects thought process
